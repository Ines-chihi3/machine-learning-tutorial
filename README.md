# machine-learning-tutorial

Helpful jupyter noteboks that I compiled while learning Machine Learning from various sources on the Internet.
it's all you need to get started with machine learning

main concept covered in this repo are :



- [linear regression](https://github.com/Ines-chihi3/machine-learning-tutorial/tree/master/machine%20Learning%20models/1_linear_reg_simple_variable) 
- [gradient descent and cost function](https://github.com/Ines-chihi3/machine-learning-tutorial/tree/master/machine%20Learning%20models/4-Gradient%20Descent%20and%20Cost%20Function)
